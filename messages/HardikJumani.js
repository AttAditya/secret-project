                It has been a pleasure learning Web Development with you,\
                 and thank you for being kind about our attendance. \
                 🙏 We promise to be on time for the next class—though \
                 you know it might be a bit tough for all of us to stick to it! \
                \
                Also, Sir, could this PR be considered for Hacktoberfest? 😅🎉"
